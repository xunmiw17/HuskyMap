# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Island 1
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Add multiple edges in island 1
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n3 in graph1
added edge e3 from n3 to n2 in graph1

# Island 2
added node n4 to graph1

# Add a self edge in the node in island 2
added edge e4 from n4 to n4 in graph1

# Island 3
added node n5 to graph1
added node n6 to graph1

# Add multiple edges in island 3
added edge e5 from n5 to n6 in graph1
added edge e6 from n5 to n6 in graph1
added edge e7 from n5 to n6 in graph1
added edge e8 from n6 to n5 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from all six nodes
