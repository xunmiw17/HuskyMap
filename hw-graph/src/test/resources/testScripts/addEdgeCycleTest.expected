# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add three nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Add three edges forming a cycle
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n3 in graph1
added edge e3 from n3 to n1 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from all three nodes
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n3(e2)
the children of n3 in graph1 are: n1(e3)
