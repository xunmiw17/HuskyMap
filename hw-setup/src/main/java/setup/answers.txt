## Part 7: Answering Questions About the Code

1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

It failed the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test because it threw IllegalArgumentException when n is equal to 0,
which is non-negative number. I had to change the condition to throw an IllegalArgumentException from n <= 0 to n < 0.


2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

It failed the testBaseCase test because it threw an IllegalArgumentException when n is equal to 0. Same as above, I had
to change the condition to throw an IllegalArgumentException from n <= 0 to n < 0.

3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

It failed the testInductiveCase test because when n is equal to 2, it is supposed to return 2 (since the first index of
the sequence is 0) but it actually returned 1. To fix it, I had to change the condition to return 1 from n <= 2 to n < 2.

## Part 8: Debugger Tutorial

1. What are the values of "x", "y", and "sum" printed by your statement? Why was x not equal 
to the first integer entered here, and how could we fix this?



2. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel? What does the “frames” 
tab list as the current method and line number? (Write down the text that was highlighted when 
the Debug perspective first opened.)



3. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel after each of the two step overs?
