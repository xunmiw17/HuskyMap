## Part 7: Answering Questions About the Code

1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

    It failed the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test because it threw IllegalArgumentException when n is equal to 0,
    which is non-negative number. I had to change the condition to throw an IllegalArgumentException from n <= 0 to n < 0.

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

    It failed the testBaseCase test because it threw an IllegalArgumentException when n is equal to 0. Same as above, I had
    to change the condition to throw an IllegalArgumentException from n <= 0 to n < 0.

3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

    It failed the testInductiveCase test because when n is equal to 2, it is supposed to return 2 (since the first index of
    the sequence is 0) but it actually returned 1. To fix it, I had to change the condition to return 1 from n <= 2 to n < 2.

## Part 8: Debugger Tutorial

1. What are the values of "x", "y", and "sum" printed by your statement? Why was x not equal 
to the first integer entered here, and how could we fix this?

    The values of "x", "y", and "sum" are 4, 4, and 0 respectively. x was not equal to the first integer entered because
    we calculate "x" by dividing the first integer by 2 and then multiplying the result by 2. Since division in Java rounds
    down to an integer, the result of 5 / 2 would be 2. To fix this, we need to avoid the "divide and then multiply" approach
    and directly give x the value of the first integer entered.

2. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel? What does the “frames” 
tab list as the current method and line number? (Write down the text that was highlighted when 
the Debug perspective first opened.)

    x = 3 and y = 4 are listed in the "Variables" panel. The current method listed in the "frames" tab is "computeSum", and
    the line number is 45.

3. What are all the names and values listed in the “Variables” panel after each of the two step overs?

    After the first "step over", the listed names and values are:
        args = [],
        console = java.util.Scanner[delimiters=\p{javaWhitespace}+][position=3][match valid=true][need input=false]
                    [source closed=false][skipped=false][group separator=\x{2c}][decimal separator=\x{2e}][positive prefix=]
                    [negative prefix=\Q-\E][positive suffix=][negative suffix=][NaN string=\QNaN\E][infinity string=\Q∞\E],
        x = 3,
        y = 4

    After the second "step over", the listed names and values are:
        args = [],
        console = java.util.Scanner[delimiters=\p{javaWhitespace}+][position=3][match valid=true][need input=false]
                    [source closed=false][skipped=false][group separator=\x{2c}][decimal separator=\x{2e}][positive prefix=]
                    [negative prefix=\Q-\E][positive suffix=][negative suffix=][NaN string=\QNaN\E][infinity string=\Q∞\E],
        x = 3,
        y = 4,
        sum = -1
